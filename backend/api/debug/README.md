A place for debug endpoints to report network status and diagnostic information in a development environment.

These endpoints will be called by a future frontend and display information about the network status, peer0 will be designated as the peer responsible for making endpoint calls to the other servers and will be the peer with the debug ui running on a port in react or something when we get a frontend up and running.
